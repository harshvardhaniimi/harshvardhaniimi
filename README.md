## Hi there, I'm Harshvardhan! Welcome to my digital garden. ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using analytical techniques to solve real-world problems. When I'm not deep in data, you'll find me engrossed in a bookðŸ“š, out on a hikeðŸ¥¾, experimenting in the kitchenðŸ¥˜, or unwinding with musicðŸª•.

### Current Endeavors
I'm currently a doctoral student of [Business Analytics and Statistics](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics) at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee. I am also an intern with HP Inc.'s Strategic Planning and Modelling Team, where I build [ML forecasting models](https://www.harsh17.in/hp22/) to forecast the demand for printers worldwide. But my learning doesn't stop there, I'm constantly picking up new techniques and tools to better solve the problems I encounter.

### Newsletters and More
I share my learning journey and more in a free weekly [newsletter](https://harsh17.in/next) - _Next: Today I Learned About Data Science_. It's a curated collection of Data-Sciency works and has found resonance with 200+ subscribers. The format is simple: five stories, four packages, three jargons, two tweets and one meme.

### Past Adventures
My previous exploits include completing a BA and MBA from [IIM Indore](https://iimidr.ac.in) in April 2021, and being an ERASMUS+ exchange student at the [University of Latvia](https://www.lu.lv/en/) from Feb-Jun 2019. 

I've also worked on many [projects](https://www.harsh17.in/project/) from [Kaya](https://huggingface.co/spaces/harsh17/shiny-cat), my GPT-powered pet cat, R packages on [Indian postal codes](https://www.harsh17.in/indiapin/), [vaccine demand predictions](https://www.harsh17.in/malaria-vaccine-coverage/), and marketing of [humanoid robots](https://www.harsh17.in/invento-robotics/).
