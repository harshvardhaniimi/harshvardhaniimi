**Personal website: https://www.harsh17.in.**

I am learning analytical techniques to solve real-life problems. In my free time, I readðŸ“š, trekðŸ¥¾, cookðŸ¥˜ and listen to musicðŸª•. Recently, I started a [newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/harshbutjust) on R which is popular with 120+ subscribers.

> **A short and sweet curated collection of R-related works. Five stories. Four packages. Three jargons. Two tweets. One Meme.**
