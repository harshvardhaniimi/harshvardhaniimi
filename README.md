I am learning analytical techniques to solve real-life problems. In my free time, I readðŸ“š, trekðŸ¥¾, cookðŸ¥˜ and listen to musicðŸª•.

I am currently a doctoral student of [Business Analytics and Statistics](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics) at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee. I completed BA and MBA from [IIM Indore](https://iimidr.ac.in) in April 2021. I was an ERASMUS+ exchange student at the University of Latvia ([Latvijas Universitate](https://www.lu.lv/en/)) between Feb-Jun 2019.
